Dear all, 
  How are you doing?  
  
How to Email a Resume?
 
Use an effective subject line
Address the hiring manager by name
In the first paragraph, tell the hiring manager who you are and why are you contacting them
In the second paragraph say what value you’d bring to the company
Close the resume email body with saying you’re eager to meet in person
Add a professional signature with your contact details
Attach your resume and a cover letter saved in PDF with professional file names
 

Before I show you how it works in practice, I want to introduce you to someone.

 

Meet Jason. He’s a successful Web Developer. He wants to join XYZ Corp. as an IT Manager. And the email he sent to XYZ’s hiring manager will get him there.
